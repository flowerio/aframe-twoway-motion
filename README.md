## Demos

- [Fancy House by 3Dio](https://fasility.com/components/twoway-motion/demos/fancy-house.html)
- [4 murals by Howie Green](https://fasility.com/howie)

Tap to move forward. To move backward, look downward, then tap.  
Movement speed and downward threshold are adjustable.  

## Usage 

Make sure you are using A-Frame 0.7.0 or later. Then include aframe-twoway-motion.js in your HTML:
```html
<script src="[location of repo's dist]/twoway-motion.js"></script>
```

Then attach it to your `<a-camera>`: 
```html
<a-camera twoway-motion="speed: 35">...</a-camera>
```


## Parameters:

**Parameter** | **Default** | **Description**
------------ | ------------- | --------------
**speed** | 40 | Motion speed. `40` is a brisk walking pace. 
**threshold** | -40 | The x angle at which the cursor will turn orange and motion will be backward. `-10` would be just below the horizon.
**nonMobileLoad** | false | twoway-motion will not run unless it is on a mobile device. Set nonMobileLoad to `true` to load it anyway. 


## Technical Details

- This is a lightweight alternative to `Universal Controls`. Does not require physics. 
- Plugs directly into A-Frame's native `wasd-controls`.
- Has no effect on desktop or Oculus/Vive scenes. Works only on mobile devices via AFRAME.utils.isMobile(). 
- Ignores multitouch (Touch events with more than one touch point). 
- Does not preventDefault on the Touch event. You can still click things with the cursor. 
- twoway-motion is not for 360 pictures. It will only distort the 360 panorama in interesting ways. twoway-motion is for exploring 360 scenes on mobile in handheld and cardboard modes.

- Archilogic's 3dio for their absolutely amazing models!

- Thanks to Don McCurdy for starting the party with A-Frame Extras' `Universal Controls`!
